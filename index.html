							<p class="major">Graphic design is an established concept but one with many layers of personality. Trends in graphic design change every now and then, with a specific trend becoming obsolete for a certain time only to return at a future period with better results. This is not surprising in any way since the world is also rapidly changing. <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a> and released for free under the <a href="https://html5up.net/license">Creative Commons</a>.</p>

							<h2> Customized Typography</h2>
							<p>Japanese graphic designers are fond of using custom typography in their creations. If you have studied a bit of the Japanese language, you’ll understand the justification behind the use of customized typeface.

							<p>If you have already been to a Japanese city or neighborhood, like Tokyo, Harajuku, and Shibuya, you will notice the Japanese people’s love for bright and vivid colors. The streets of these cities are bustling with life and color. If you scroll through their design culture, you will notice that most of their designs are painted in red, gold, and black hues, among other colors.</p>

							<h2>Suzuki Kohei</h2>
							<p>The cute culture or “kawaii” is used all over Japan, from television shows to telecommunication companies, rice packaging, and other merchandise. This cute culture is deeply embedded in the Japanese artistry and love of fun. They believe that through cute drawings, they are able to remove any hostility from the audience but instead develop a more intimate relationship with them.

							<h2>Tommy</h2>
							<p>If you have entered a Japanese home before or observed what it looks like as portrayed on Japanese anime, you would have noticed the minimalistic design they use. The Japanese have as little furniture as possible. Likewise, decorations in the house are scarce, if not totally absent.</p>

										<p>Complex gradients, once you master the art of using them, can be very helpful to bring life to your background and give color to your design. If you’re tired of using mono tones, this is the perfect answer for you. Start with using pastel colors and experiment from there until you get the best gradient.

										<p>The Japanese take pride in their culture and tradition. As much as they embrace changes, i.e. technological advancement, they also place high regard on preserving their ancient customs. They find ways to infuse these traditions into modern designs. For instance, calligraphy (or “shodou” in Japanese) is an important part of the Japanese culture.</p>

							<h2>History</h2>
							<p>A very brief history of the last 200 years of Japan is essential to understanding why Japanese graphic design is where it is today. Prior to the Meiji Era, which began in 1868, Japan had closed borders</p>
							<div class="items style1 medium onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Tokogawa shogunate </h3>
									<p>With the fall of the Tokogawa shogunate and opening of Japan’s borders, Japan was now free to trade with the outside world and a reciprocal trade of culture began. This not only had a profound effect on Japanese art and design, but also a profound effect on what is considered “Western” art and design.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-save"></span>
									<h3>development </h3>
									<p>The next important step in the development of Japanese graphic design was during the Post-War years. Between the 1950s and 1980s, Japan underwent an incredible economic boom, becoming the third largest economy in the world. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-chart-bar"></span>
									<h3>1990s,</h3>
									<p>Then in the 1990s, Japanese graphic design exploded! Fully embracing Postmodernism, Japanese designers further carved their own unique ideals into graphic design. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-wifi"></span>
									<h3>Characteristics and Traits</h3>
									<p>As a result of Japan’s unique history and equally unique culture, which is a fascinating study in its own right has led to Japanese graphic design being its entire own genre in the field of graphic design. Everything from folklore to religion, flowers to technology have played a part in how Japanese graphic design has looked throughout history and even how it looks today in the 2020s.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Minimalism</h3>
									<p>Japanese Minimalism is born from the country’s Zen Buddhist tradition and its embodiment of “less is more”. Japanese Minimalism rejects modern consumerism and aims to keep life, and in our case design, as uncluttered and simple as possible.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon style2 major fa-paper-plane"></span>
									<h3>asymmetric</h3>
									<p>Given the religious tradition and more modern interpretations on Minimalism in Japan, it has found its way into Japanese graphic design. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Kenya Hara f</h3>
									<p>Though there are many examples we can choose from, we think the work of art director Kenya Hara for the now-global Japanese brand Muji exemplifies this perfectly.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-sync-alt"></span>
									<h3> principles</h3>
									<p>Muji’s founding principles is Minimalism and the company runs a “no-brand” or “no logo” policy across all its products—so it comes as no surprise that Hara’s design for the company is the same.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-hashtag"></span>
									<h3>Muji </h3>
									<p>Minimalism in Japanese graphic design goes beyond Hara and Muji though. We love this Minimalist approach Yuta Takahasi took for the editorial of a special Japanese version of Trinität by German philosopher Michael Debus.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-bolt"></span>
									<h3>Kawaii</h3>
									<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum from Japanese Minimalism and Zen Buddhism is the concept of Kawaii. Kawaii is the culture of cuteness and since the 1970s has exploded into Japanese popular culture and influenced the way that the world sees Japan and its culture.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-envelope"></span>
									<h3>predominance</h3>
									<p>Given its predominance of Japanese popular culture, it comes as no surprise that Kawaii has also had an influence on Japanese graphic design and Japanese packaging in particular. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-leaf"></span>
									<h3>packaging</h3>
									<p>Though it’s not just food packaging that has got the Kawaii-treatment. For instance, this Tokyo Bosai (a manual for disaster preparedness in Tokyo)</p>
